# My SQL Data Analysis Project

## 📌 About This Project
This is a data analysis project I built to practice my SQL skills. I used a real-world dataset to answer business questions and find interesting patterns. 

I learned how to write SQL queries to organize, filter, and understand data better.

## 📂 What Is In This Folder?
* **Data:** The `csv` files containing the raw data I used.
* **Scripts:** The `.sql` files where I wrote my code to solve the problems.

## 🛠️ What I Learned
By working on this project, I practiced:
* **Basic SQL:** Creating tables and selecting data.
* **Filtering:** Finding specific information using `WHERE` and operators.
* **Aggregating:** Using `GROUP BY` to summarize data (like finding averages or totals).
* **Cleaning:** Fixing messy data so it is ready for analysis.
